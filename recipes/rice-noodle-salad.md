## Method

### Step 1

Prepare the rice vermicelli noodles according to their packet instructions and marinate the tofu.

### Step 2

Meanwhile prepare the dressing by adding the rice wine vinegar, fish sauce, lime, sugar, garlic and ginger in a small bowl and stir until the sugar has dissolved. Set aside.

### Step 3

Cook the tofu in a small frypan over a medium heat until browned, this will take around 5 minutes.

### Step 4

While the tofu is cooking prepare the salad vegetables, herbs and chilli and then begin to assemble the salad.

### Step 5

Portion the cooked noodles between 2 salad bowls – I use about 1.5 cups of noodles per bowl so you may have some noodles left over which can be used for rice paper rolls. Then top with the lettuce, carrot, cucumber and the cooked tofu.

### Step 6

Then add the spring onions, herbs, chilli and fried shallots and dress the salad to taste.

### Step 7

Serve immediately.
